# World of Warcraft Anti AFK 

Just a simple Python script to avoid long queues while playing World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King classic. 

## Attention!
> Currently English version is broken. We know about this and fix issue when we have some time. 

## Why does this exist?

Right now it becomes really big problem, coming to the point where you can't walk away from PC to the store without fear of missing your RT or just free time to play after work. This is main reason for creating this repo. 

> Warning: Use this repository at your own risk. I doubt Blizzard can ban you for using this repo, but if you decide to stand like this 24/7, it becomes more realistic.

I strongly advise against trying to use this repository around the clock. No one can forbid you, but it was created for ordinary people who just want to play the game and avoid huge queues at times when they need to go away or stand in line before coming home.

## How to use

I give you instructions for Windows, but this thing should also work on Linux and MacOS.

1. You need to install [Tesseract](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) and **add it installation folder to** [PATH](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).
2. Install all python requirements.
3. Start main.py, select you game language (Russian/English) and open WoW window.
> At the moment we have added Russian and English support, but the code is written so that you can easily add new localizations.
4. Enjoy! 

Currently already tested only on Russian, so if you have any problems with English version - give us feedback and we gonna fix it =)
